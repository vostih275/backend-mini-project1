# Backend Mini Project – Simple Blog Page

## Description
This is a group backend project built with Node.js and Express, using JSON file storage instead of a database and EJS templates for server-side rendering.  
The project implements a Simple Blog Page, where users can view all posts and individual posts by ID.  

## Features
- View all blog posts (`/posts`)  
- View single post by ID (`/posts/:id`)  
- Server-side rendering using EJS  
- Modular backend routes (`src/routes/posts.js`)  
- Safe JSON reading to prevent errors if `posts.json` is empty or malformed  

## Technologies
- Node.js  
- Express  
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)  
- File System (`fs` module) for JSON storage

Notes & Guidelines
No database is used; JSON file storage is implemented with the fs module
Modular code is used for routes (routes/posts.js)
All team members must participate; commits should be visible on Git history
No AI-generated code is allowed
Document all changes in the README if you add new features
Sample posts in posts.json should be 20+ posts for proper testing
Deadline: February 14

Testing

Basic manual testing was carried out:
-The server starts successfully using `npm start`
-The `/posts` route displays all blog posts 
-The `/posts/:id` route display a single post correctly 
-Invalid post ID do not crash the application
-JSON data is read safetly to prevent runtime error
