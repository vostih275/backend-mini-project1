# Backend Mini Project – Simple Blog Page

## Description
This is a group backend project built with Node.js and Express, using JSON file storage instead of a database and EJS templates for server-side rendering.  
The project implements a **Simple Blog Page**, where users can view all posts and individual posts by ID.  

## Features
- View all blog posts (`/posts`)  
- View single post by ID (`/posts/:id`)  
- Server-side rendering using EJS  
- Modular backend routes (`src/routes/posts.js`)  
- Safe JSON reading to prevent errors if `posts.json` is empty or malformed  
- CSS styling loaded via `public/styles.css` for all pages

## Technologies
- Node.js  
- Express  
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)  
- File System (`fs` module) for JSON storage  

## Folder Structure
src/
 app.js              # Main application entry 
 routes/ 
  posts.js          # Modular routes for posts 
   data/ posts.json        # Sample blog posts in JSON 
   views/ posts.ejs         # Template to render all posts 
          post.ejs          # Template to render single post 
public/                # Static files (CSS, images)
package-lock.json       # Autamatically generated by npm
package.json     # Project metadata and dependencies
README.md      # Project documentation

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vostih275/backend-mini-project1.git
Navigate into the project:
cd backend-mini-project1
Install dependencies:
npm install
Start the server:
npm start    # Run (Production Mode)
npm run dev    # Run (Development Mode with Auto-Reload)
Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:3000

Routes:
/           → Simple homepage
/posts      → View all blog posts
/posts/:id  → View a single post by ID

Notes & Guidelines
No database is used; JSON file storage is implemented with the fs module
Modular code is used for routes (routes/posts.js)
CSS styling is served from public/styles.css and applied to all pages
All team members must participate; commits should be visible on Git history
No AI-generated code is allowed
Document all changes in the README if you add new features
Sample posts in posts.json should be 20+ posts for proper testing
Deadline: February 14

Testing
Basic manual testing was carried out:
The server starts successfully using npm start or node src/app.js
The /posts route displays all blog posts
The /posts/:id route displays a single post correctly
Invalid post ID does not crash the application
JSON data is read safely to prevent runtime errors
